I am a 5th year PhD Student at Boston University Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I am also a core member of the [Security Lab (SeclaBU)](https://seclab.bu.edu/) and collaborated with [International Data-driven Research for Advanced Modeling and Analysis Lab (iDrama Lab)](https://idrama.science/) in the past.

Research
======

My research lies on the cusp of cybersafety, applied machine learning and social computing, where I aim at understanding, detecting, and combating online harms using a data-driven approach.
My research process involves identifying pertinent issues within cyberspace and developing tools to mitigate the malicious behavior with the goal of offering policymakers guidelines to ensure user safety on social media platforms.
