I am a 5th year PhD Student at Boston University Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I am also a core member of the [Security Lab (SeclaBU)](https://seclab.bu.edu/) and collaborated with [International Data-driven Research for Advanced Modeling and Analysis Lab (iDrama Lab)](https://idrama.science/) in the past.

Research
======

My research lies on the cusp of cybersafety, applied machine learning and social computing, where I aim at understanding, detecting, and combating online harms using a data-driven approach.
My research process involves identifying pertinent issues within cyberspace.
I conduct large-scale analyses on relevant datasets to extract valuable insights and discern patterns associated with the phenomenon in question.
With a more nuanced understanding of the issue, I develop tools to mitigate the malicious behavior with the goal of offering policymakers guidelines to ensure user safety on social media platforms.
